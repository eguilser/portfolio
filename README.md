# 📊 **Project Title: Interactive Routing Algorithm Visualization**

Welcome to the **Interactive Routing Algorithm Visualization** project! This application brings complex network routing algorithms to life with intuitive visualizations, helping users understand how algorithms like **Dijkstra's** or **Bellman-Ford** work in real-time.

---

## 🌟 **Features**

- 🚀 **Real-time visualization** of routing algorithms on dynamic graphs.
- 🔄 **Interactive controls** to add/remove nodes and edges.
- 📈 **Performance comparison** between algorithms.
- 🎨 Clean and responsive UI built for both desktop and mobile users.

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages

## 💡 **How It Works**

1. **Create Your Graph**: Use the interactive canvas to add nodes and connect them with edges.
2. **Select an Algorithm**: Choose from supported algorithms like **Dijkstra's** or **Bellman-Ford**.
3. **Visualize the Pathfinding Process**: Watch the algorithm calculate the shortest paths step by step.
4. **Compare Algorithms**: Analyze their performance with side-by-side comparisons.
